# Filter Finagler, an SVG filter editor.

A bit. Not really. The "editing" bit isn't there. It's still work-in-progress. Verrrry work in progress.

## Known Issues

- The Editors don't work/haven't been built. This is kind of a deal-killer. Check back later.
- feComponentTransfer is probably broken. It's the oddball filter element that has children, so I have to treat it special.
